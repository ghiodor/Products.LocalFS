Zope documents.</p> 

<p class="form-help">
This works by mapping a directory (called the 'base path') on the Zope server 
machine to a folder-like object in Zope. All of the subdirectories and files 
under this path are mapped to Zope objects by reading the contents of the file 
from the file system each time the object is requested. (For many operations 
this is optimized to speed up performance.)</p>

<p class="form-help">
The Zope process must have permissions at minimum to read from the specified 
directory, or to write to the directory to enable file uploads. All uploaded
files are initially owned by the same user as the Zope process.

<p class="form-help">Specify remote shares using the UNC notation: 
\\server\share\path. You may also need to enter a username and a password.
<strong>Note:</strong> When run as a service, Zope by default runs under 
the System account, which does not have the permissions to map network
drives. You must specify a username with sufficient privileges to
use network shares unless you run Zope under a different account.</p>
