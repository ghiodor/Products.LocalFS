Local File System - Add: Add a Local File System.

  Description

    This view allows you to create a new Local File System.

    Local File System objects allow you to serve files and browse directories 
    in Zope from the local file system.
    
    When you add a Local File System object to a folder, the path to the
    file system object becomes the "mount point" for the file system. The object
    has a property called "basepath" which works just like the base path of a
    regular web server.

    For example, if you create a file system object in the root folder
    with an id of 'images' and set the base path to '/usr/local/www/images', 
    then the url http://zopeserver/images/bullet.gif will display the file 
    /usr/local/www/images/bullet.gif.
